## Student question on EdStem

>> **_What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?_**  <br />
 Computer and operating system: Windows on my personal laptop. Editor: VSCode. Browser: Google Chrome. <br /> <br />
>>**_Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”._**<br />
>> I'm running grade.sh with one of the sample student repositories that has bugs in it. TestListExmples.java 
>> has 4 tests, and 3 are meant to always fail (I'm doing this to test whether my script correctly displays when an implementation is incorrect).
>> I'm expecting to get  a message that prints that the code faile
>>**_Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can._**
