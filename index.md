## Hello world
This is a website where you can see how every Markdown basic syntax works (more information on [this cheat sheet](https://commonmark.org/help/)):

*This is what italicized text looks like.*
**This text is very bold**

# This is the first heading type
## This is the second heading type

You can create [hyperlinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvwZQTB4iv4) with Markdown 

You can also add images! Here is a dog: <br />

Here are some programming languages sorted from best to worst:
1) Python
2) Scratch
3) C
4) Java

Here are a few lines of code in different programming languages!: <br />
```
# Hello World in Python
print("Hello world")
```
```
# Hello World in Java
public class myClass {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Hello world");
  }
}
```
```
# Hello World in C
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   // printf() displays the string inside quotation
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```
C is kind of bad, but Java is the worst offender.
