# CSE 15L Lab 1 Report

Welcome to CSE 15L. In this tutorial, you will learn how to install VSCode, how to remotely connect to a remote computer and some useful bash commands. 

## Step 1: Installing Visual Studio Code
First, go to [the official VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the installer that corresponds to your operating system

## Step 2: Setting up bash and connecting remotely using ssh (secure shell)
First, make sure that you have git installed. In Windows, a quick way of checking is by pressing Win + R to open the run tab and then typing in cmd to open the command prompt

Once the command prompt is open, type in git and hit enter.

 If a list of commands shows up, it means that git is most likely installed in your computer. If you get anything along the lines of *'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file*, then you will have to install git.
 To install git, go to [this page](https://gitforwindows.org/) to download the installer.
 
 Once git is setup in your computer, follow [this StacKOverflow post on how to use bash in the VSCode terminal.](https://gitforwindows.org/)
